# RL_DiffDrive
Progressing complexity of reinforcement learning regarding mobile robots. The purpose of this project is academic in nature to understand core concepts.

The initial test was conducted on a simple grid layout with specified obstacles, as established in the main train and test scripts and visualized in grid_world.py. The learning model was Q Learning, using the q_learning.py script in agents. main_test.py and main_train.py are the training and testing scripts, but need to have their environments (grid size and obstacle locations) established within these scripts.
